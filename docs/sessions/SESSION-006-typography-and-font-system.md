# Session 06 – Typography and Font System

## Goal

Introduce a custom font system and improve the typography of the Hero section.

---

## What was implemented

### Typography

- Introduced a dedicated `fonts.css` stylesheet.
- Registered custom fonts using `@font-face`.
- Added support for multiple font weights:
  - Regular (400)
  - SemiBold (600)
  - Bold (700)

### Font system

- Introduced a typography design token:

  - `--font-family-primary`

- Applied the token globally through the `body` element.

### Font selection

- Compared Sora and Manrope.
- Evaluated both fonts visually.
- Chose **Manrope** as the primary typeface because it better matched the desired tone of the portfolio.

### Hero improvements

Improved the visual hierarchy by introducing dedicated classes:

- `.hero-title`
- `.hero-role`
- `.hero-statement`

Adjusted:

- font sizes
- font weights
- line heights
- spacing between content blocks

The Hero now has a clearer reading order and improved vertical rhythm.
